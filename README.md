# Pet_Adoption

/*


This is a MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) stack application for pet adoption management.


## Setup Instructions

Follow the steps below to set up and run the application on your local machine.

### 1. Backend Setup

Navigate to the backend folder and install the dependencies:

    cd backend
    npm install

Then, run the backend server:

    npm run dev

You should see the following message if everything is working:

    Connected to MongoDB
    Server running on port 5000

Note: MongoDB is already configured with a public IP, so you don't need to change anything to connect to the database.

### 2. Frontend Setup

Now, open a new terminal, navigate to the frontend folder, and install dependencies:

    cd frontend
    npm install

Start the frontend development server:
